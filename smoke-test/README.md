# 100-company smoke test

A clean run of the submitted agent, done the way the evaluator runs it: fresh clone of this repository at
commit `4ab5560`, `uv sync`, then one command, with no pre-built data or caches.

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m signalpost run --organisations organisations.txt --output-dir smoke/ --state-dir state/ --run-id smoke-100
```

`organisations.txt` is 100 companies drawn at random (seed 20260928) from the public 411,160-company list.

| | |
|---|---|
| Results | 100 of 100 envelopes, all with a terminal state; validation passed |
| Evidence | 2818 of 2818 evidence records carry a public source URL, retrieval time and the exact supporting text (`claim_span`) |
| Requests | 1167 in the batch + 1 one-time setup |
| Time | 4.1 min for the batch; first-run setup (register bulk download, lookup tables) adds a few minutes |
| Third-party cost | $0 |

Checks on this commit:
- Determinism: a second fresh run of the same input gave identical facts for 100 of 100 companies
  and identical evidence (ids, sources, quotes) for 100 of 100.
- An immediate rerun with the same `--state-dir` reported **0 changes** (idempotent refresh).
- Audit: 0 problems (every published claim has evidence, no dangling or duplicate claims).

Files: `envelopes.jsonl` (one result per company), `run-report.json`, `requests.jsonl` (every outbound
request), and `site/` — the static viewer for these 100 profiles (open `site/index.html`).
